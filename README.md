run_analysis.R
==============

This is a repository for the course project of the online course Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera.

Information about the data can be found in CodeBook.md 

The R code does the following:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
for each activity and each subject.

The data can be downloaded from:

Extract the data into your R working directory.

When the code is fully run, a text file named "FinalData.txt" would be created which would be our required data set.
